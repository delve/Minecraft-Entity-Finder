======================
Minecraft Entity Finder 
======================

(or more accurately "Minecraft Named Entity Finder")


Forked from "Minecraft Region Fixer" by Scott Bratcher (swbratcher)

Locates mob entities that have had name tags applied to them giving
them the CustomName attribute in their entity data, then returning that
they were found and at what position they were found using the entity's
Pos array to deliver the X,Z coordinates.

My son lost his dog, Turbo, and we found it with my mods to this fork. 
Pretend your name tag offers the GPS chip that fancy dogs are afforded. 


TODO: 
Will be removing all past functionality that tries to fix corrupted 
chunks in region files using old backup copies of the Minecraft world.
It will no longer fix or modify after I gut the script set and it won't 
fix any problem in these files.

Supported platforms
===================
This program seems to work with Python 2.7.x, and DOESN'T work with
python 3.x. There is also a windows executable for ease of use, if you
use the windows executable you don't need to install Python.
(But I don't use windows, so hopefully I don't gut what allows that to work.)


Usage
=====
You can read the program help running: “python region-fixer.py --help”

Here's what I used to find Turbo, my son's dog:

    $ python region-fixer.py --name-tags /Users/[my_user]/Library/Application\ Support/minecraft/saves/[my_world]/

Where [my_user] was swbratcher and [my_world] was world (the default minecraft world save file name).

Here are some other (likely gutted) examples of pre-fork functionality:

From v0.1.0 Region-Fixer can scan single region files and arbitrary 
region sets. For example, if you know where the problem is you could 
scan a single region file instead of scanning the whole world. You 
can also scan a few region files from different locations. Example::

    $ python region-fixer.py ~/.minecraft/saves/World1/region/r.0.0.mca 

    Welcome to Region Fixer!

    ############################################################
    ############## Scanning separate region files ##############
    ############################################################
    Scanning:  1 /  1 100% [########################################] Time: 00:00:01

    Found 0 corrupted, 0 wrong located chunks and 0 chunks with too many entities of a total of 976

The next example will scan your world and report any problems::

    $ python region-fixer.py ~/.minecraft/saves/corrupted-world

    Welcome to Region Fixer!

    ############################################################
    ############ Scanning world: Testing corruption ############

You can use --verbose or -v option if you want more info. This option 
will print a line per region file showing problems found in that region 
file.

To delete corrupted chunks you can use "--delete-corrupted" or "--dc"::

    $ python region-fixer.py --delete-corrupted ~/.minecraft/saves/corrupted-world

If we have a backup of our world we can use them to fix the problems 
found chunks, this method can spam a lot of output text, because writes 
a log for every chunk that is trying to fix::

    $ python region-fixer.py --backups ~/backup/2013.01.05/ --replace-corrupted ~/.minecraft/saves/corrupted-world

These options have an equivalent for wrong located chunks.

Another problem that Region Fixer can fix is an entity problem.
Sometimes worlds store thousands of entities in one chunk, hanging the
server when loaded. This can happen with squids, spiders, or even items. 
A very common way to make this happen in your server is to ignite a few 
thousands of TNTs at the same time. All those TNTs are entities and 
the server will hang trying to move them all.

This problem can be fixed with this method. Using the option 
"--delete-entities" Region Fixer will delete all the entities in that 
chunk if it does have more entities than entity-limit (see the help). 
It doesn't touch TileEntities (chests, singposts, noteblocks, etc...). 
At the moment of writing this Entities stored in chunks are:

- mobs
- projectiles (arrows, snowballs...)
- primed TNT
- ender crystal
- paintings
- items on the ground (don't worry chests are safe)
- vehicles (boats and minecarts)
- dynamic tiles (falling sand and activated TNT)

Note that you still need to load the chunk in Region Fixer to fix it, 
and it may need GIGs of RAM and lot of time. You can use this in
combination with "--entity-limit" to set your limit (default 300
entities, note that a chunk has 256 square meters of surface and if you 
put a mob in every sun lighted block of a chunk that will make 256 
mobs, so it's a big limit!)::

    python region-fixer.py --entity-limit 50 --delete-entities ~/.minecraft/saves/corrupted-world

From version v0.1.0 there is also an interactive mode for Region-Fixer. 
If you don't know what's wrong with your world this mode can be very
useful. To start using the mode use the '--interactive' option::

    $ python region-fixer.py --interactive ~/.minecraft/saves/corrutped-world

In this mode the scan results are saved in memory, so one scanned you 
can delete chunks, delete entities, replace chunks, replace chunks with
too many entities and read a summary of what's wrong without needing to 
scan the world again. Example of usage::

    $ python region-fixer.py --interactive ~/.minecraft/saves/corrupted-world

Warning
=======
This program has been tested with a lot of worlds, but there may be 
bugs, so please, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WORLD BEFORE RUNNING it,
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WORLD. Other way to say it 
is USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Think that you are playing with you precious saved games :P .

Good luck! :)
